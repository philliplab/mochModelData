Title: Data for the mother child model
Description: This package carefully documents the process by which the source
    data for the project was turned into the input parameters for the modgen
    model. The goals of the package are 1) Provide a complete audit trail for
    all data manipulations. 2) Provide comprehensive documentation that will
    make it easy for anyone to replicate all the steps. 3) Make some of the
    tools and tricks used to get the data to work with the model available to
    other users of the model.
