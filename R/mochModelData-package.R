#' Data for the mother child model
#' 
#' This package carefully documents the process by which the source
#' data for the project was turned into the input parameters for the modgen
#' model. The goals of the package are 1) Provide a complete audit trail for
#' all data manipulations. 2) Provide comprehensive documentation that will
#' make it easy for anyone to replicate all the steps. 3) Make some of the
#' tools and tricks used to get the data to work with the model available to
#' other users of the model. 
#' 
#' The package is organized as follows. The source
#' data (as obtained from emails etc) is available in the extdata/src_dat
#' folder in the project. A readme file in that directory provides more details
#' about the source data. If modifications had to be made to those files that
#' were much easier in EXCEL or another tool, the source data was modified and
#' the modified copy was stored in extdata/modified_dat. A readme file in that
#' folder describes how the modified data was constructed. 
#' 
#' The actual data that is
#' used to produce the input parameters can be found in the data folder in .rda
#' format. This data can be loaded in R via data(). Each dataset in the
#' data folder will have comprehensive documentation on how to obtain it from
#' the src_dat or the modified_dat.
#'
#' The data included in the package is further manipulated into the formats
#' required by the model using the various functions in the package. These
#' functions follow the following conventions. 1) Their names are formatted
#' like this format_x where x is the name of the parameter in the model. This
#' is the internal name of the parameter in the model and not the label of
#' that parameter. 2) The functions produce an output file. This is because
#' the model requires 1 dimensional vectors. This package specifically
#' inserts comments in this 1 dimensional vector to greatly improve the
#' readibility of the output data. 3) The function is based on a number
#' (usually 1) of the datasets of the package. 4) The function will provide
#' arguments that allow one to provide different datasets to these function,
#' but if no arguments are supplied, the internal datasets will be used.
